## Installation
### Option 1: Clone Repository
In the root of your Hugo site directory run:

```console
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/tomanistor/osprey.git
```

### Option 2: Create Submodule

Then run:

```

## Using Osprey
The two main content types are blog posts and gallery images.

### About Section
To create an about section that renders on the home page, run:

```console
$ hugo new about.md
```

### Blog Posts
To create a new blog post, run:

```console
$ hugo new blog/post-title.md
```

### Gallery Images
To add a new image to your portfolio, run:

```console
$ hugo new gallery/image-title.md
```

The gallery archetype comes with its own configuration. Here is an example:

```md
+++
date = "2017-05-10T21:35:17-07:00"
title = "Image Title"
image = "image-file.png"
alt = "This is a description of the image"
color = "#7ac143"
link1 = "https://tomanistor.com"
link2 = "https://github.com/tomanistor"
+++
```

### Contact Form
Two contact forms services are offered as options: Formspree and Basin.

#### Formspree
_Update 4/15/18 - [Formspree no longer offers newly set up AJAX contact forms for free. This is now a Formspree Gold feature.](https://github.com/formspree/formspree/pull/173)_ You can either use the non-AJAX version of Formspree (which redirects to a Captcha page on form submit) by setting the config.toml parameter `ajaxFormspreeGold` to `false`, sign up for Formspree Gold and set the parameter to `true`, or sign up for Basin and use their contact form service for free.

The email address specified in the config.toml file will be the one receiving messages sent through the contact form. The contact form is operated by Formspree and requires that the form must be submitted once initially to confirm the email address being used. See instruction [here](https://formspree.io/).

#### Basin
Basin is an alternative, free AJAX contact form service. To use Basin, [sign up for a free account](https://usebasin.com/users/sign_up) and create a form. Copy and paste your form's URL endpoint to the `ajaxBasin` config.toml parameter. Select the `Submit this form via AJAX` option on your Basin dashboard.

### Custom CSS
To implement custom CSS sitewide, change the config.toml parameter `customCSS` from `false` to `true` and then create a `css.html` file in your `layouts/partials/` folder like the example below:

```html
<style>
  <!-- This will remove the shadow on the navbar -->
  nav {
    box-shadow: none;
  }
</style>
```

This will render inline CSS in the head of your site and without adding an extra HTTP request.

### Cache Busting
As of `v2.1.0`, this theme uses native [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/introduction/) for cache busting of assets. Generated assets will be served from the `resources` folder and will no longer require any additional setup with Gulp.
